<h2>The Steinmetz Lab is hiring!</h2>

We are looking for curious, motivated, and talented individuals who are interested in joining a new lab focused on employing cutting-edge electrophysiological, imaging, and behavioral techniques to answer questions about the neural basis of cognition and behavior.

<p> We are committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field, so we encourage applications from individuals with unconventional backgrounds or from underrepresented groups.</p>

<p><h3>Post-doctoral scientists</h3>

If you like asking hard questions, making things work, and pursuing creative ideas with state-of-the-art tools then this lab may be for you. Prior experience with neurophysiology and advanced data analysis are desirable. Please apply <a href="http://apply.interfolio.com/59776">here</a>. Informal inquiries welcome to nick.steinmetz@gmail.com.

<p><h3>Research technician / laboratory manager</h3>

We are looking for a bright, conscientious individual to work as a technician and laboratory manager.
