<h2>Our statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion in science</h2>
<p> Academia has systematically excluded Black and indigenous people of color. Additionally, the fields of systems and computational neuroscience in particular exclude women. As a lab we are committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field. 

<p> All lab members are encouraged to spend a portion of their work hours on mentoring, outreach, and education, including participating in the lab's reading group on these topics. Our lab action plan includes: improving support for junior scientists from under-represented groups; working to improve departmental hiring policies; and improving representation in our journal club, in citations in our papers, and in seminar series we attend. 

<p> We recently participated in a faculty search for our department, and a detailed review of the practices that we employed to reduce biases and enhance diversity can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/BioStr_Faculty_Search_2021-22_DEI_review.pdf">here</a>.
