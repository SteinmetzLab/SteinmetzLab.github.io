<h2>NEUSCI 490: Seminar in Computational Neuroscience</h2>
<p>Computational Neuroscience, in brief, is concerned with the use of computational tools (statistics, ML, simulations, modeling, etc) to study the computations of the brain (perception, decision-making, memory, motor planning, etc). In this course we will hear about the cutting-edge research of leading computational neuroscientists in Seattle in discussion-oriented lectures by the researchers themselves. Homework assignments are short written responses to prompts based on reading one of their latest papers, and there is no final exam. 1 Credit. This course is ideal for anyone looking for a deep (but sparse) dive into the latest computational neuroscience research, with ample opportunity for direct discussion of the work with the researchers themselves. Feel free to contact me with any questions - nsteinme@uw.edu.
