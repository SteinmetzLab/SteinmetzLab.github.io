<p> The Steinmetz Lab at the University of Washington in Seattle and the <a href="https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/">International Brain Lab</a> are seeking a research scientist to join our global collaboration. 

<p>We’re looking for someone with experience in electrophysiology and rodent systems neuroscience, and with a passion for building and carrying out high quality experiments. The scientist in this position will work with the latest cutting-edge neuroscience tools including yet-unreleased versions of Neuropixels. 

<p>Unusually, we are <i>not</i> looking for an academic-track scientist, i.e. not a postdoc. The lack of high quality jobs in neuroscience other than very limited faculty positions is a big contributor to toxic aspects of our field such as ‘publish or perish’ culture and the emphasis on flashiness over substance. This position is an alternative: we want someone for whom doing high-quality neuroscience is the goal.

<p>The successful candidate is expected to have a degree (BS, MSc, or PhD) in neuroscience or in relevant quantitative fields such as engineering, physics, computer science, statistics, or mathematics, and is expected to have a strong background and interest in experimental and analysis methods in neuroscience. Pay will depend on experience. But if you have a PhD, it will pay more than a postdoc.

<p>The Steinmetz Lab is committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field, so we strongly encourage applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds or from underrepresented groups. See our statement on diversity in science <a href="/dei/">here</a>.
